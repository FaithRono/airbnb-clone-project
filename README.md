# Airbnb Clone Project

## üìå Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive full-stack web application inspired by the real-world Airbnb platform. This project simulates the development of a booking system, focusing heavily on backend systems, database architecture, secure API development, and deployment automation. The aim is to build a scalable and secure platform that supports essential features such as property listings, bookings, user accounts, and payment integration.

### üéØ Project Goals:
- Design a robust backend architecture using Django.
- Create and manage a relational database with MySQL.
- Develop secure, RESTful, and GraphQL APIs.
- Collaborate effectively through GitHub.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment.
- Ensure a high level of security and scalability.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Entities and Attributes

- **User**
  - id (PK)
  - name
  - email
  - password_hash

- **Property**
  - id (PK)
  - owner_id (FK ‚Üí User)
  - title
  - location
  - price_per_night

- **Booking**
  - id (PK)
  - user_id (FK ‚Üí User)
  - property_id (FK ‚Üí Property)
  - start_date
  - end_date

- **Review**
  - id (PK)
  - user_id (FK ‚Üí User)
  - property_id (FK ‚Üí Property)
  - rating
  - comment

- **Payment**
  - id (PK)
  - booking_id (FK ‚Üí Booking)
  - amount
  - payment_status

### Relationships:
- A **user** can list multiple **properties**.
- A **booking** is made by a user for one **property**.
- A **review** is written by a user for a property.
- A **payment** is linked to a booking.

## üöÄ Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**
  - Registration, login, logout, and profile update features.

- **Property Management**
  - CRUD operations for listings (create, edit, delete, view).

- **Booking System**
  - Date selection, availability checking, and booking confirmation.

- **Review System**
  - Users can review properties they've booked.

- **Payment Integration**
  - Secure and simple interface for processing payments.

---

## üîê API Security

- **Authentication**
  - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for secure access.

- **Authorization**
  - Role-based access control to ensure users access only what they‚Äôre allowed to.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

- **Data Encryption**
  - Passwords are hashed; sensitive data encrypted during transmission (HTTPS).

- **Importance**:
  - Protect user credentials and personal data.
  - Prevent unauthorized bookings or property modifications.
  - Ensure safe financial transactions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

- **What is CI/CD?**
  - Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate the process of testing and deploying code.

- **Why it's important**:
  - Reduces human error
  - Ensures consistent deployment across environments
  - Speeds up development cycles

- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions** for running automated tests and deployments
  - **Docker** for containerization of the application
